# Deployment

[Back to home](../README.md)

**Note on eas**

* Deployment is done with eas.
* All env vars are setup directly inside the encrypted `eas.json` file
>  This is the case because for some reason, I was not able to have the dotenv module that injects env variables directly in the js runtime using `eas` work properly
* The above file is completely ignored on dev environment, so the dev environment are read from the `.ENV` file
* This means the variables stored in the `.ENV.*` files is only used for the dev environment

**Note on application bundles**

* üçè Apple app bundles are outputed to a `.ipa` file
* ü§ñ Android app bundles are outputed to two different format
  * `.aab` Android App Bundle is a new format, it can only be submited to the play store
  * `.apk` Android App Package is the old format. It is heavier, so you should prefer aab to submit to the play store. However, this bundles can be submited to the play store, or downloaded and installed directly on a device, which is convenient

**Note on bundle ids**

The application has 3 bundle ids, the bundle id identifies the application on the device, that explains you can have 3 versions of the application on a single device. If you try to install an application and its bundle id already correspond to an installed application on your device, it will be upgraded.

* com.reconnect.CloudSolidaire.debug
* com.reconnect.CloudSolidaire.preprod
* com.reconnect.CloudSolidaire.prod

> For Android, this bundle identifier is called applicationId, it is setup inside the `app/build.gradle` file, and it shoud not be mistaken with the `packageName` which is `com.reconnect.CloudSolidaire` and it the same for the 3 plateforms

**Note on application signing**

‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è
> Application signing credentials is stores inside the encrypted `credentials.json` file, but I did not succeed in configuring the preprod and the prod environment
> The best of the wortsts solution I found is to commit an extra file, `credentials.prod.json`. The `credentials.json` it the one used by `eas`, it will be committed with the preprod credentials. If you want to dpeloy in the production environemnt, you will need to copy the content of the `credentials.prod.json` inside the `credentials.json` before deploy

* üçè Apple packages are signed with a provisioning profile, it ensures the identity of the developper that built the package
  * For debug, preprod, and prod, 3 different provisioning profile exist and you need to use the right one while building
  * Obtaining these provisioning profiles is a really complex workflow, however, Expo abstracts all this complexity
* ü§ñ Android packages are signed with a keystore
  * Keystores are not needed on the debug environment
