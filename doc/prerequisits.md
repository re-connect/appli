[Back to home](../README.md)

## Middlewares

* NodeJs, version 20 is OK
* Grab a package manager, yarn 1.22 is great
* Cocoapods (get it with Brew, or as a Ruby dependency, then install ruby (2.7), and gem, and then cocoapods as a gem)

## Devices

**Developping on physical devices** should be pretty straightforward and need no extra dependencies, you should download the [expo GO app](https://expo.dev/go) on these devices

**To develop on simulators**, you will need a few extra setup
  * **Android:** Android Studio, Java (17 is recommended, you can setup the Java SDK in Android Studio), setup your simulator
  * **iOS:** First, you will need a Mac Computer üçè, install Xcode, xcode-command-line-tools, watchman (fetch with Brew)


If you have any problem, you can refer to this documentation that will be more exhaustive and up to date
