# Development

[Back to home](../README.md)

### Run

Local development is done using expo CLI, you can either install expo cli globally, or use npx

* `npx expo run:ios` (or `expo run:ios` if globally installed)
* `npx expo run:android`

> For the first run, you may be prompted to generate the first application build with `npx expo build:android/ios` , in that case, you may need to do the full setup for build, meaning installing Java, Xcode, ..., expo won't save you this time
